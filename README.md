## installation

If you would like to run this app locally you will need python3 and direnv installed. After those are installed, set up a virtual enviroment in the `./server` folder with `python3 -m venv .venv`. You will also need to add a `.envrc` file with `source .venv/bin/activate`. After you have added the `.envrc` run `direnv allow` in `./server` so that the virtual enviroment is automatically activated when you enter the server directory.
